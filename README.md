This is a **lightweight**, **auto-generated** and **thin** Swift wrapper around the popular and excellent [**dear imgui**](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) library.  
It provides a swiftly and typesafe API and is easily maintainable and updatable, since it relies heavily on auto-generation.

There is a working [demo example](Sources/Demos/Metal) provided as part of the library.




## Dependencies

Since SwiftImGui is merely a wrapper around **imgui** it obviously depends on it. 
It also makes use of the excellent c-api wrapper cimgui.
Here are some credits to the authros.

----

Dear ImGui is a **bloat-free graphical user interface library for C++**. It outputs optimized vertex buffers that you can render anytime in your 3D-pipeline enabled application. It is fast, portable, renderer agnostic and self-contained (no external dependencies).

Dear ImGui is designed to **enable fast iterations** and to **empower programmers** to create **content creation tools and visualization / debug tools** (as opposed to UI for the average end-user). It favors simplicity and productivity toward this goal, and lacks certain features normally found in more high-level libraries.

Dear ImGui is particularly suited to integration in games engine (for tooling), real-time 3D applications, fullscreen applications, embedded applications, or any applications on consoles platforms where operating system features are non-standard.


### cimgui credits

##### From [cimgui/cimgui/README.md](https://github.com/cimgui/cimgui/blob/master/README.md)

CImGui is a thin c-api wrapper programmatically generated for the excellent C++ immediate mode gui Dear ImGui. All imgui.h functions are programmatically wrapped. Generated files are: cimgui.cpp, cimgui.h for C compilation. Also for helping in bindings creation, definitions.lua with function definition information and structs_and_enums.lua. This library is intended as a intermediate layer to be able to use Dear ImGui from other languages that can interface with C (like D - see D-binding)
